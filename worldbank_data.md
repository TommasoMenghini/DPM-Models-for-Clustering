Description of the Country_Data Application
================
As described in the [`README.md`](https://github.com/TommasoMenghini/DPM-Models-for-Clustering/blob/main/README.md) file, this tutorial provides general guidelines and code to perform clustering using **Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) models** on the Country_Data dataset. Specifically, it covers the following:

- How to **sample from a selection of multivariate Dirichlet Process Mixture models with Gaussian kernels**;
- Methods to **assess the convergence of the MCMC chain**;
- Implementation of the **SALSO algorithm with the VI loss function** to determine the optimal posterior partition of the data;
- Visualization and interpretation of **key graphical results** related to the clustering process;
